# StudyPlannerApp

It is a web app to help plan and analyze your studies (Idea came from a problem that every teacher has their own website
and students have to check 5-6 different sites to find all the materials, homeworks and deadlines).
Functionalities:
    (For end users (students) all available curricula, modules and subjects would be in system)
    1. Choose your curriculum
    2. Choose your subjects for each semester
    3. Add tasks under subjects (description, deadline, expected time required)
    4. Create and Share subjects and tasks
    5. Mark available time for studying
    6. Set when and for how long you plan to study
    7. Change the status of your tasks and subjects

The app will provide:
For students: 
    1. Shows how many EAP's are still required in each module (both declared and completed)
    2. Shows how much time you spent on certain tasks (helps to estimate required time for other tasks, but is
       mainly useful for next year students who do the same/similar tasks)
    3. 

For teachers:
    1. Shows how much time students on average spend on their course(can adjust the volume to match EAPs)
    2. Gets accurate and immediate feedback on the difficulty of each task

Technologies:

Ambition:
    Mainly to learn the technologies and the general process to develop a web application.

Current state:
    For this ambition it is complete

Shortcomings:
    - Tests
    - Visuals
    - Front end interactivity
